# 🚀 About Me
From support technician to QA analyst, my journey has been about one thing: making technology work better for people. I’m not just passionate about clean code—I care about *why* it matters. Through customer service, internal training, and deep-dives into automation frameworks, I’ve developed a sharp eye for detail and a strong instinct for collaboration.

I recently completed a **QA Automation Bootcamp with Cloudberry** where I learned how to write test scripts in Java, automate mobile apps with Appium, and integrate it all through CI/CD pipelines. The experience boosted both my technical skillset and confidence in tackling real-world QA challenges.
